Given the query below, decide whether it needs expansion.  

Expand the query if any of the following apply:  
- It contains abbreviations or acronyms ‚Üí replace them with their full forms.  
- It is too broad or vague ‚Üí add minimal context to make it retrieval-ready.  
- It lacks domain-specific terms that are typically associated with the topic ‚Üí enrich with relevant context.  
- It is just a direct phrase or incomplete question ‚Üí reframe it into a clear query/question suitable for retrieval.  

If none of these apply, return the query exactly as it is.  

The output should be a natural search query suitable for retrieval.  
Do not include explanations, just return the final query text.

Given the query below, check if it contains multiple intents or compound questions.  
- If it does, break it down into smaller, atomic sub-queries.  
- Each sub-query must be an independent, standalone query that can be retrieved without relying on the others.  
- If not, return the query inside a single-item list.  

Return only a valid Python list of sub-queries.

Given the current query and the previous conversation history:  
- If the query depends on prior context (e.g., pronouns, references, incomplete information), rewrite it into a clear, standalone query suitable for retrieval.  
- If it does not depend on prior context, return the query unchanged.  

Return only the final query text, without explanation or formatting.
